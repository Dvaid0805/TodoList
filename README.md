Pages link - https://dvaid0805.github.io/TodoList/
Here  is a simple todo list but it completely different from what you could see on the Internet.
1)I only used the native javascript in my project(no html no css no jsqury etc.)
2)The initial  data  that appears in our list i took from Json
3)Todos that the user can add by his own and the initial todos are recorded in Local Storage and don't delete after the page reloads.
4)And finally the delete button deletes items both from DOM and from Local Storage.
